# Day-Scheduler

Using the moment.js library I created a page that allows you to save items under an hour timeslot. Depending on the time of the day the text area is a different colour. Green for future, grey for past and red for current hour. Clicking the save button saves the entry into local storage so that when the page is closed, and then reopened the items are still listed.
